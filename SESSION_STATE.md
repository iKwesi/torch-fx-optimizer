# PyTorch FX Graph Optimizer - Learning Journey

## Project Goal
Build a graph optimization tool for PyTorch models using torch.fx that:
1. Inspects computation graphs
2. Applies real optimizations (recomputation for memory, redundancy removal)
3. Verifies numerical correctness
4. Measures performance improvements

## My Background
- No compiler experience
- No graph theory background  
- No low-level performance work
- Computational graphs: 1/10
- Automatic differentiation: 4/10
- Memory management: 1/10

## Hardware
- MacBook Pro M2 (MPS acceleration available)

## Time Budget
- 7 days total
- 4-5 hours per day
- ~28-35 hours total

## Success Criteria (End of Week)
- [ ] Working optimizer with at least one optimization pass
- [ ] Numerical correctness tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks with real numbers
- [ ] Write-up documenting approach and trade-offs
- [ ] Demo notebook showing the tool in action

## Current Phase
DAY 0: Setup and crash course

## Completed
- [ ] uv environment setup
- [ ] PyTorch installation verified
- [ ] MPS working
- [ ] Project structure created
- [ ] Crash course notebook completed

## Next Steps
1. Complete crash course (notebooks/00_essentials_only.ipynb)
2. Document learning in LEARNING_LOG.md
3. Move to architecture design
